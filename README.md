# Oscillatory_shape_PD_collaborative_project

This project illustrates calculating the shape of oscillations and phase-amplitude coupling in deep brain recordings of Parkinson's disease patients. 

Notebooks: 

sharpness_notebook.ipynb: notebook to calculate the sharpness of deep brain signal (LFP)

steepness_notebook_L.ipynb: notebook to calculate the steepness of deep brain signal 



Libraries: 

filt.py for filtering in the frequency range of interest

shap_L.py and shape_R.py- functions for loading signals

shape.py - functions for quantifying the waveform shape of the oscillations. 

plt.py - functions for plotting results
